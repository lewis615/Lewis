Remove IPHLPAPI.dll from game root folder (if you have it)
请先移除游戏目录里的IPHLPAPI.dll（假如你有它的话）
Don't forget to edit config.lua and keyconfig.lua to your taste.

F.A.Q.
注意
A. My DLC items locked again/DLC unlocker isn't working/DLCs aren't working, what to do ?
为什么我的DLC物品还是锁着的/为什么DLC解锁不工作/DLC不工作，怎么办
R. Look into config.lua and set DLCUnlocker to true. (DLCUnlocker = true)
请打开 config.lua 检查 DLCUnlocker 这项是不是为 true （就是这样 DLCUnlocker = true ）
We disabled it by default, because it causes kicks/cheater tags for using DLC item you don't own (see colored list below for more information)
我们默认是把这项关闭的，因为这项功能会使你永远戴着红马甲而导致被踢被骂，假如你不介意这些问题，可以重新打开它

A. Why achievements are not working ?
为什么我拿不到成就
R. Because stats synchronisation disabled by default, you can enable in config.lua by changing NoStatsSynced = true to NoStatsSynced = false Just make sure you will set your profile visibility from public to other.
因为完美海盗在默认设置中关闭了同步数据，你可以通过修改 config.lua 重新打开同步数据，操作如下：在 config.lua 找到 NoStatsSynced = true 改为 NoStatsSynced = false ，这样你的用户数据会被公开（言下之意：可能导致你被举报什么的）

A. Name spoofing broken, fix it!
名称伪装不行了，修复它
R. Name spoofing was broken by update.
在某次更新后，这货已经完蛋了

A. My game crashes with error "Engine stopped working" after I installed trainer. How to fix it ?
在我使用修改器后，游戏崩溃了，提示"Engine stopped working" ，怎么办
R. In 99% of cases that means you installed trainer wrong or have other mods installed, like Hoxhud. Try to reinstall trainer properly and everything should work fine. If you're 100% sure that you installed trainer properly, then you can create new topic in "Support" forum section and we'll try our best to help you.
99%的问题都来自于你还安装了其他会引发冲突的MOD或者修改器，比如Hoxhud。所以请尝试移除这些可能会导致问题的MOD或者修改器再次运行游戏，如果你确认你100%你正确放置完美海盗，请到咱们的官网来，在"Support" 这个论坛板块发帖回复

A. I've installed trainer, but nothing works or shows up, what I have to do?
我正确放置了修改器，但它还是不工作，怎么办
R. To repeat, trainer will not work on Windows XP.
重复，完美海盗不支持XP
Uninstall old versions of Pirate Perfection (applies only to those, who still have v16), uninstall other lua mods/trainers. Make sure you unpacked everything from release/donor folder to main game folder. Also delete file called "PD2APIDLL1.dll".
请删除所有有关旧版本的完美海盗，同时请删除其他LUA类的MOD或修改器，然后重新把完美海盗最新版解压并正确放置到游戏目录下（假如你游戏目录里有一个DLL叫"PD2APIDLL1.dll"，也请删了它）

A. How to enable *some option* ?
怎么开启一些设置
R. Checkout config.lua and explore menus.
请把 config.lua 的内容用优秀的在线翻译翻译一次

A. NVAPI error in dll hook, how to fix it ?
提示NVAPI 错误，我该怎么办
R. Try to run game as Administrator
请在管理员模式下运行游戏

A. Do trainer have *some feature* ?
这修改器有什么与众不同的地方
R. Maybe we will write full list of what trainer can do, but why not to explore it yourself ? ;)
或许我们应该写更多内容来表达完美海盗能做到什么。笑~

A. Can I be banned from using this trainer ?
R. No way! And I doubt if OVERKILL will care to add some kind of banning system. Currently you can be visually marked on client's or server's side if you spawn illegal equipments from server and client side or illegal bags from client side. Though in next big update, they will mark you for having DLC item/heist without actually owning it.

A. I have CHEATER tag above my name, I didn't used cheats. Will you ever fix this ?
为什么我会头顶红马甲。但是我没用任何作弊功能，怎么办
R. Recently OVERKILL added code to verify ownership of DLCs. In case you have some DLC item from DLC you don't own, host will see CHEATER tag above your name and also you maybe automatically kicked, if server choosed to do so. Though it is applicable that you used some cheat randomly.
OK社在某次更新加入了新的检测方式，只要你使用没购买的DLC的物品，你就会被顶上红马甲，只要主机打开自动踢出功能，你也可能会被踢出游戏
We currently trying our best at fixing this issue. If we'll manage to get something working it will probably appear only for premium/donor users, but not sure if we'll ever succeed.
我们会尝试用各种办法解决这个问题，虽然希望不大，但是我们会竭尽全力

This is list of things these will give you cheater tag for game session/kick you outta game if you're client (if server choosed to do so):
以下列表是会使你穿上红马甲的行为，进而有可能会被自动踢出房间（假如主机开启了自动踢人选项）

From client side:
你不是主机下会导致红名的行为

	-> Spawning equipment, different from last equipment you spawned.
	-> Throwing more, than allowed amount of grenades. (Picking up grenade from grenades crate case increases limit)
	-> Spawning more than allowed amount of equipments.
	-> Attempting to secure bag different from what you currently carring. (When you secure bag, host suspects that you no longer have any bags)
	-> Attempting to spawn bag different from what you currently carring. (When you drop any bag, host suspects that you no longer have any bags)
	-> Wearing item from DLC you don't own (The most common way of being detected)

From server side:
你是主机下会导致红名的行为：

	-> Spawning equipment, different from last equipment you spawned.
	-> Throwing more, than allowed amount of grenades. (Picking up grenade from grenades crate case increases limit)
	-> Spawning more than allowed amount of equipments.
	-> Wearing item or hosting heist from DLC you don't own (The most common way of being detected)
